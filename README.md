# Naive-Bayes-Machine-Learning-Customer-Churn-Rate-Classification
I use machine learning techniques to determine customer churn rates.

In particular, I use a Naive Bayes classification technique to determine customer churn rates on the dataset.

I later produce a confusion matrix as a visual representation to determine model efficacy. 

I also interpret various statistics and visuals throughout the case study. 

This is my first attempt at something like this, so I hope I can refer back to this later to see my improvements over time.
